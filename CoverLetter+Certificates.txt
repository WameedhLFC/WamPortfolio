- I have HIPAA experience from my last project with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Novo Nordisk. My role was an ETL Data Analyst. During that time I learned about the various data sources we had in place (ZS, IQVIA and CDM) which were used by different teams (CDW, NBA and BI). I was a member of the CDW team and got exposed to some of the techniques adopted by other teams such as data modelling in Tableau and the use of performance tables. I was involved in producing, testing and documenting all the mappings and transformations performed on data pertaining to medications (products), HCP's, insurance companies, sales representatives, pharmacies, etc. We aligned these data to territories and used them to introduce a plan of action for sales representatives to follow and to detect certain behaviors. The raw data that came from various sources arrived at different intervals as CSV files stored on S3, which we then staged in Snowflake warehouse, processed and transformed using Informatica PowerCenter, created dimension, fact, normalized, historic data and other types of intermediate tables. Final data was unloaded back to S3 for users and other teams to consume for their purposes such as generating visualizations and reports. I was also involved in the discussions about requirements with providers of the raw data or whoever consumed our data after processing. I was inolved in processing the data coming from Veeva CRM warehouse. All activities in the Snowflake warehouse  were conducted using the appropriate frameworks (staging, streaming, archiving, unloading, cloning, onboarding)
